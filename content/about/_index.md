I'm a data scientist with a research background and interest in Social Psychology and Marketing.

I current study Data Science at Institute of Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University. Prior to joining Harvard, I worked at Legendary Entertainment Applied Analytics where I worked in marketing research.
Before joining Legendary, I graduated from UC Berkeley studying Psychology. My senior thesis focuses on studying the phenomenon of loss aversion in a lottery decision making scenario.
