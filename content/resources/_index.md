# Additional Resources 
#### (for Data Science)

Many have asked me how did I learn (Python, R, LaTex, Git...). I want to share resources that I have used/heard good things about. Learning how to program for me involves a lot of online searches as well as trial and error. However, when I learn completely new techniques, I find it helpful to start with some structured online resources to understand basic concepts, hence, the list below hopefully can serve as a starting point for you.

## R
I learned R from various classes at UC Berkeley, including Stat 133 and a DeCal class. Therefore, I don't have personal experience with any online resources.

### ggplot2
ggplot2 is one of the most popular plotting libraries in the R community.
[ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html)
- Cheatsheet on the website is helpful for me

### dplyr
dplyr introduces grammar of data manipulation to R and Data Science.
[dplyr webiste](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

### Shiny
Shiny is a popular R web application framework that allows you to build interactive web application using R and R syntax
[Coursera - Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)
- I have personally taken this class to learn about Shiny
[RStudio Shiny Tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
- I found the tutorial and gallery helpful

## Python
I learned Python through UC Berkeley [Data 8](http://data8.org/) class.
- The class is now available through [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-science-computational-uc-berkeleyx-data8-1x)

## Data science
Data Science is such a broad topic that it is hard to list resources. There are a few books that I think are great for beginners. I however did not learn from books. I learned mostly through work experience and projects.
[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## LaTex
I found [codecogs](http://latex.codecogs.com/) helpful when looking for LaTex syntax

## Git/version control
I learned Git through many trial and error.
[GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/)
- I found the GitHub help page very helpful with the screenshots

[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)
- I have heard good things about the book, particularly targeting R users.
